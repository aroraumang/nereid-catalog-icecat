This module extends the
[trytond-icecat](https://github.com/openlabs/trytond-icecat) module using
TreeNode from nereid-catalog-tree module. Along with ICECAT product, categories
are imported as well along with their parents and stored in TreeNodes.

From user perspective the workflow remains similar to trytond-icecat, as they
will still be using same wizard provided by trytond-icecat with same inputs.
